<p style="color:black">Once upon a time in History story being told by a boy who loved a girl soo much <strong>he didn't want to spend a day without her .</strong></p><br>
<p style="color:black">The story begins in the year of <strong>2019 September 13 </strong> it was in the morning I was browsing on facebook adding people<em> you may know</em> I saw a photo of an anime girl I haven't felt so alive when I saw that photo. That photo was a girl wearing sport clothes, I did add her  and it changed my life .<br>
While she accepted it , firstly I tried to talk to her , haha well at first she said<em> "am weird"</em> and I told her <em> "am used to it "</em><br>
Well at first we argued about school thing that " is she still schooling" <br> 
It did end well though . She got used to me because I reacted with haha on her profile picture (pp) and she returned that <em>haha</em> on my profile picture too . She started talking to me and she said something I won't forget she said <strong> We all know that the sun doesn't set without us having an argument</strong> I was happy.<br>
We enjoyed each others company until we dated . That was amazing thing in my life I loved her with everything I got <br>
More like I loved her Soo much .well it did end in tears after that we broke up <strong> on 27 November 2019</strong> but we did continue chatting I knew she loved me but she was confused she didn't know who to  choose between me and Kazui . I called her over the phone talked about everything ,  personal life she was open to me and I really loved that , wish I could have done more for her .<br>
We enjoyed new years Eve together and new year began <br>
She was opened to me again told me how important to her I am and another thing I won't forget she said<strong> "Even if I die tomorrow Ntuthuko I will look after you even am in  hell or in heaven I will always guide you.</strong> <br> 
<strong>She's Soo amazing</strong> . Days pass and weeks we had a major problem between us there was a huge distance between us she was busy with school work and they was another day when she was giving up damn sacrificing herself for me .<br>
I told her that she should sleep because it is school tomorrow but she said " <strong>aww I was prepared for you tonight to make it up for you because we haven't spend time like we used to "</strong><br> 
But she did listen and she did sleep </p><br>

<p style="color:black">Days  pass again she had some personal stuff too even now I don't know them .<br>
 she needed time so I gave her time until she called me that now she is all good now , she made my night on that night <br>
Days pass well those ones I don't like them we had a fight bad one <br>
I fixed it though I apologized for interacting in her personal life she forgave me we continued talking again .
This time she was new and old at the sametime. Well she did confuse about her feelings about me again said <strong>"Ntuthuko I love you "</strong> . We dated again happy and new she was serious about it . We had a bad time again , I said she was pregnant even though I knew that she haven't slept with no one she was frustrated, sad and disappointed for what I have said to her . It was cold I tried and tried to make her stay and cool off. <br> 
She did come back to me and forgave me <strong>again</strong>
We continued again and dated until some guy ,came along between us<em> to be honest I hate that dude </em> he almost took her from me <br>
After those challenges we loved each other more but I didn't release myself that am toxic in this relationship that I don't want to be wrong or make any mistake I was wrong about that <br>
She did told me though she said "am little too much controlling and she didn't like that "but then again I didn't listen<br>
I saw her comment on facebook in some group that post was saying" If you would name your movie what would be it  name " she said <strong>The greatest villain</strong> yeah am kinda jealous about that but it is a good name <br>
Well days pass again she acted strange too strange this time I tried but it didn't work I saw her reaction when I wrote some messages. She was sad about something but she didn't want to come out .<br></p>

<p style="color:black">We had a fight again worse all of them  I told her that she shouldn't comment in some ways not to post those things .I didn't realize that now am being a bully controlling .<br> 
We broke up on that fight it almost took me away losing myself I don't know how did she took it though but I won't lie it was hard for me and for her too being disappointed by someone you trust and love  , I had some friends though helping me their names are <strong>Fiona , Angel, Vincent , Ayakha , Sotho , Nkosi and Alijado</strong> . Even though am not still Heald I still need some time I wonder  what is she doing? how is she? Those are they questions does she have another guy now  , I think she really meant it when she said " it over for good this time " . Every time I tell myself maybe it is dream but it is reality she won't come back I know now but if she still wants to come back , she should let her pride go and ego who knows maybe she will find a good guy for her person who will understand her more than I did , I wish I could still have time with her but it is impossible now <br>
I used to think bad of you  Charity and that was wrong  , am trying my best not to be like that person I was in the past . I wanted to  look good on you but I forced that and forced things don't work out .<br> I feel it in my heart that it is not good at all to wish bad things to someone it like poisoning yourself myself and I hate to pretend as if everything is okay , am not okay since the day you left and I can't blame you for that . This is my journey mine alone and God too I really can't be anything with without him .<br> 
Am angry and confused I think it her or am angry at myself you see am still confused I hope I can find help soon . Take care of yourself Charity Afrika</p>
